<h3> Sameday Courier shipping method plugin </h3>

<strong> Overview </strong>

<p> This plug-in is intended to implement a new shipping method using the Sameday Courier service.  As a store owner, after installing the plugin, you are able to import the list of Sameday Courier service and delivery points assigned to your account.   If your customer chooses the order to be delivered with Sameday Courier, you will be able to see this in the list of commands in your store's administration panel.  You will also be able to create an AWB. You can then add a new parcel in the created AWB and show the AWB as a pdf format.   If you want, you can show the AWB history or delete the AWB.</p>


<strong> Account & Pricing: </strong>

<p> Using this plug-in is free. However, the service offered by our company is based on a contract. The terms and conditions of the contract are negotiated individually. After signing the contract, the client will receive a set of credentials (username and password). With these credentials, the customer will be able to use the Sameday Courier delivery service. </p>
